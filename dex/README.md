### TOKEN SWAP

DogeBark let users trade without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange. Everything you do on DogeBark is routed directly through your own walletâ€”no need to trust someone else with your coins!

### Liquidity Pools

DogeBark DEX (Decentralized Exchange) can only operate when there's enough liquidity to support trades, For example if nobody wanted to sell you $Bark, then it wouldn't matter how much you wanted to trade for some.&#x20;

Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use.

You can stake your LP Tokens are our farm to earn $Bark
